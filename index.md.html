# About
B.S. Psychology graduate from UCI with an interest in the intersection of psychology and human-computer  interaction.

Research interests: Equity in video games, telehealth and Internet communications, and media studies.

When I am not working, I enjoy drawing, painting, writing, violin, hiking, and playing video games!

# Now
* Searching for work in my post-bacc period and exploring life's options.
* Working on my ever-growing list of personal creative projects, primarily short stories and illustrations.
* You can see more in-depth updates on my [blog](blog.md.html).
* Reading lots of books, manga, and playing plenty of video games!


# Research
* *Sexism, Streamers, and Simulated Avatars* [(pdf)](#) - My undergraduate thesis submitted for the Campuswide Honors Collegium at UCI. A meta-analysis of literature on livestreaming, toxicity in online gaming spaces, and the use of virtual avatars in streaming -- colloquially known as "VTubing".
	* Presented in [poster format](proj/urop_vtuber.png) at the UCI Undergraduate Research Symposium in 2023.
