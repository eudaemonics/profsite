            <p>There was a story at my school. They said my school was haunted – some generic story of a girl who died decades ago. It would change depending on whom you asked: some said she committed suicide, and others said she died when a fire broke out at the school… it wasn’t ever consistent. I knew that there was a kernel of truth in all of them, though. All rumors have at least one true thing.</p>
            <p>I learned that yes, there was a fire at the school. No, there were no suicides on school grounds that were recorded. There were records of mortalities, but no names, just numbers. Some of the dates lined up. That was enough to satisfy my curiosity.</p>
            <p>The rituals to get her to appear were all different too. Some said you had to wear a red ribbon around your pinky and cut the ribbon when you get to the roof, and others said you had to walk up the stairs with a mouth full of saltwater. Some said you had to put your hair up or else she’d light it on fire.</p>
            <p>Since I wasn’t sure which would work, I decided to do all of them at the same time. I tied my hair up and emptied salt packets into a plastic bottle, the emptied packets drifting lazily to the bathroom floor like the petals of a dying flower. Tepid tap water flowed from the faucet into the bottle then over my hands, drenching the ribbon tied around my finger. I wondered briefly if that would affect the ritual, but I shrugged it off since these legends were never <em>that</em> specific. Rumors were more about the intent than the actions. Once it was full, I capped it, shook the bottle, and watched the salt dissolve into the clear liquid.</p>
            <p>I’d stayed after school hours before, but I had to be more quiet than usual this time. Most people didn’t stay after on Fridays. And besides…I didn’t want people asking why I was drinking bathroom tap water.</p>
            <p>With the bottle pressed to my lips, I filled my mouth with saltwater and took care not to swallow any. I poured it in until my cheeks poked out like pufferfish. Since I took extra care so no one would notice me and so I wouldn’t spill a drop of water, ascending the stairs took forever.</p>
            <p>Once I reached the top, I pushed the heavy door leading out onto the rooftop open. After glancing around quickly, I undid the ribbon on my pinky and waited.</p>
            <p>“Y’know, if you’re trying to look ridiculous, you’re doing a really good job at it”. Startled, I spun to look at the speaker with my cheeks still full of water. A lanky girl leaned against the wall behind the door, right where a less observant person wouldn’t see. We locked eyes… and I wasn’t sure whether to swallow or spit out the water. But as if reading my mind, she said, “…You can spit it out, you know,” the girl spoke while a mischievous smile crept onto the ends of her mouth.</p>
            <p>I spat it out, though her laughter made it feel like I was vomiting in slow motion. Her eyes remained fixed on me while I wiped my face with my sleeve and spat out the salt sticking to my tongue. She didn’t look like a ghost, at least not at first glance. Long and messy brown hair draped over her shoulders. Her hazel eyes reflected the sunset’s reddish light in an almost unearthly way – as if she was staring right into my heart.</p>
            <p align="center">* * * * * *</p>
            <p>“Are you the–”</p>
            <p>“The ghost? If you want to call me that, sure.” She stood straight and walked towards me like a curious animal. “You’re the first person not to run off screaming to tell her friends.” She inched closer and closer, her golden eyes shimmering with unknowable intent. I rubbed my damp hands against my skirt and gripped it tight to hide my trembling.</p>
            <p>“I just wanted to find out the truth,” I almost said, <em>I don’t have any friends</em> which wouldn’t have been a <em>lie</em>… but it’s not something I wanted to tell the not-ghost not-human girl.</p>
            <p>“The truth? Hah, I think I’m better left as a rumor barely clinging onto life,” she laughed frostily. Though, it’s nice to not have someone running off, for once.” Her fingers combed through her hair, and she looked at me again with those piercing eyes. “…But… you don’t look like one of those goth occult-y types that <em>usually</em> come up here to harass me.” Curiosity colored her words, even if it wasn’t an obvious question.</p>
            <p>“…I was wondering if there was someone up here to stop me.” The words flowed naturally from my lips. I felt like the air around her was pulling my feelings out of my chest, spilling them for everyone to see.</p>
            <p>“Stop you?” She asked.</p>
            <p>My eyes darted away from that unshakeable gaze. I knew that if I kept going, I wouldn’t be able to stop.</p>
            <p>Silence filled the space between us, punctuated by the chirps and coos of birds flying overhead. I walked away to the edge of the rooftop. A wire fence was the only barrier that stood between me and the ground, which lay far, far below. The shadows’ crosshatch pattern covered the whole roof in a cloak as if its solidness was dissolving in the early evening shadow. Faint footsteps approach me from behind and a hand pressed lightly on my shoulder, but I barely noticed until she started speaking again.</p>
            <p>“You don’t have to tell me, but I can’t promise to ‘stop you’,” Her words would’ve sounded unfeeling to anyone else, but to me, they were the greatest comfort. Everyone else – the few who would listen anyway – would press me for the finest details. They’d ask as if they hadn’t already turned a blind eye towards me, all the people who would walk away when those girls cornered me, and–… no, these feelings aren’t for display here, either. My pain isn’t for anyone else’s entertainment. I turned to the spectral, yet material girl who seemed to occupy a space in between those worlds.</p>
            <p>“But do you understand how it feels… to just be a spectacle?” I struggled to meet those burning eyes of hers, those that were filled with more vitality than my own.</p>
            <p>“I do,” she stepped closer to the fence and put her fingers through the openings. “I mentioned earlier, didn’t I? Those goth occulty types just come up here to harass me,” her mouth twisted into a grimace.” To them, I’m nothing more than a grotesque rumor given shape. Proof of whatever fantasy they have of this school’s ‘dark secret’,” she removed her fingers which clinked against the fence as they made contact with the metal, then she looked at me. With the sunlight behind her and the shadows cast over the roof, her form melted into the darkness. “You don’t have to tell me anything now, but I’m always up here,” her expression of disdain turned into one of kindness. “It is nice to have someone that isn’t running off in fear or to tell people that ghosts are real.”</p>
            <p>I instinctively drew closer to her. Was it pity? Sympathy? Did I feel like she was a kindred spirit? I wasn’t sure. I wasn’t even sure if she was a ghost, a demon playing a prank on me, a figment of my imagination, or someone playing along with my delusions for their amusement. But it didn’t matter, for once, I felt seen, not obligated to spell things out for someone. Cautiously, I wrapped my arms around her. I was afraid that holding her too tightly would make her shatter and disappear.</p>
            <p>She felt intangible in my arms as if she’d disappear if I took my eyes off of her for even a second. At that moment, I took that risk and closed my eyes. Something pressed to my forehead, too soft to be a hand yet too light to be a cheek. From the warmth, I imagined it was her lips. It was too faint to be a kiss, but just enough to show she understood what I was trying to say without words. Us two spectacles were alone at last.</p>
            <p>We stayed that way for what felt like an eternity. I was afraid that if I clung too long, she’d disappear. I pulled away from her, and my worries were confirmed. Instead of the phantom I had embraced, there was nothing there but empty air – she hadn’t even left an afterimage. Yet this instilled a strange sense of security in my heart as if I knew we’d see each other again when the time was right.</p>
