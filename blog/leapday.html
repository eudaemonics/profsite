<h1 id="leap-day-rmarkdown-for-site-management">Leap Day &amp; RMarkdown for Site Management</h1>
<p>It&#39;s leap day so I guess I wanted to write up something small for it? It only comes around once every 4 years, so I&#39;m not sure why we don&#39;t celebrate it more!</p>

<p>I&#39;ve given the site a bit of a facelift since as much as I liked my last style, I need to work on my CSS skills some more until I get it figured out. I was also thinking of using a proper static site generator for this facelift, but...I ended up turning to a tool I&#39;m already adequately familiar with: RStudio.</p>
<p>I used RStudio a lot in my undergrad and while there&#39;s still a lot I need to learn, RMarkdown as an own SSG is pretty useful and versatile and most importantly: not intimidating for me since I use Markdown basically every day. Admittedly it took a lot of googling for me to understand the YAML parameters -- I really need to take notes about how to write a good YAML header. At least I managed to get a functional header and footer working? Special thanks to <a href="https://holtzy.github.io/Pimp-my-rmd/#text_formating">Holtz</a> for this quick and easy tutorial on RMD to HTML and injecting HTML snippets into my site.</p>
<p>For CSS, I&#39;m using vanilla CSS, which is a very cool <a href="https://vanillacss.com/">open-source</a> style sheet that I really liked the look of. Though I did adjust some of the colors to give my site more flavor.</p>
<p>I also updated the <a href="../creative.html">gallery</a> to be more aesthetically pleasing too. I love Roy Francis&#39; <a href="https://github.com/royfrancis/pixture">pixture</a> library which made organizing and adding things to my gallery so much easier, though I need to figure out how to add captions if that&#39;s even possible. If I take enough pictures on my trip next month, I&#39;ll use this when I make a post about it.</p>
<p>Everything else started out as plain Rmd files that I outputted into HTML, but there&#39;s a billion tutorials for this online, so I&#39;ll leave you to find that out for yourself.</p>
