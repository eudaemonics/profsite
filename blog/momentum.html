<h1 id="the-year-of-momentum">The Year of Momentum</h1>
<p>Something I&#39;ve borrowed from a podcast I listen to is the idea of <a href="https://www.relay.fm/cortex">yearly themes</a> in lieu of yearly resolutions. Let&#39;s face it: None of us <em>actually</em> try to stick to those resolutions we make every year...so I&#39;ve found that instead having a driving idea or word that defines every year much more helpful, and I wanted to think about how my 2024, the &quot;Year of Momentum&quot; is going.</p>
<h2 id="work-academic-life">Work/Academic Life</h2>
<p>I&#39;ve managed to somehow score both a job and an internship, which is very good! And they&#39;re both things that I am interested in exploring and experiencing.</p>
<p>Working with California Children&#39;s Academy as a teaching assistant is a great opportunity, and working with children in a classroom setting is something I have always wanted to do. I think that this will open a lot of doors for me, especially in helpinh me decide which path I&#39;d like to take with my future career and if I really want to work with children in this sort of setting.</p>
<p>I&#39;m also very honored to be recruited into the <a href="https://theaapdn.org/GIC.html">Global Intern Collaborative</a> and to work with one of the most eminent pediatric psychologists in the Orange County area -- I never imagined that I&#39;d be accepted to such a helpful and close-knit community, and I am very excited to see where this opportunity leads me.</p>
<h2 id="personal-life">Personal Life</h2>
<p>I&#39;ve finally gotten my license, which I am very excited about. Living in Los Angeles is, honestly, not my cup of tea, but driving is one of those necessary evils that I would have had to face sooner or later. I&#39;d already put it off long enough, so I am very happy to finally have it.</p>
<p>I&#39;m still working on practicing various languages, including computer languages... Hopefully next time I update this site it&#39;ll be a bit cleaner as I am planning to transition to <a href="https://github.com/sunainapai/makesite">makesite</a> once I have a better grasp of Python.</p>
<p>Recently I had the pleasure of going to see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamome_Shirahama">Shirahama Kamome</a> in persona at Anime Expo 2024. She&#39;s the author of one of the most influential works in my creative life, <em>[Witch Hat Atelier]</em>, so getting the chance to see her in person and observe her do a live drawing was something I never imagined would happen. It&#39;s really motivated me to continue working on my stories and art, even if they take a while to finish...</p>
<h2 id="summing-it-update">Summing it update</h2>
<p>I think overall, the first half of the year of momentum has been very successful, even if it&#39;s a little slow. I can&#39;t wait to see what the rest of the year has in store!</p>
