<h1 id="about">About</h1>
<p>BS Psychology graduate from UCI with an interest in the intersection of psychology and human-computer interaction. I graduated with honors from the Campuswide Honors Collegium and am a proud transfer student from Los Angeles Pierce Community College. Currently centered in California.</p>
<p>I was also a proud member of the Neon Anteater Renaissance during my time at UCI. I contributed art, writing, and did graphic design for advertising posters.</p>
<p>My research interests include: equity in video games, ethics, telehealth, informatics, generational trauma, and media studies.</p>
<p>When I am not working, I enjoy drawing, painting, writing, violin, hiking, writing HTML websites about my interests, and playing video games!</p>
