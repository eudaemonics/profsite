<h1 id="about">Coventine O.</h1>
<p><strong>Psychologist, sociologist, data enthusiast, creative artist, gamer, and someone who likes to act like a writer.</strong></p>
<p>My research interests are mostly focused on the intersection of psychology and informatics--human-computer interaction, for lack of a better word. I'm passionate about self-expression and media studies, and these are key themes in my work.</p>
<p>This corner of the internet is a place to host some of my work in an accessible fashion and is also where I post some of my <a href="/blog.html">brain dumps</a>. I'll let you decide if those are interesting or not.</p>
